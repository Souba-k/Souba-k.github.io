Hello

I decided to start a quite useless project. I want to write from scratch a Risc-V core and an assembler for this core. The goal is just for me to learn as much as I can about computer architecture and have fun. I will try to go as far as I can, but for now I will limit myself to a single core without pipeline running a fibonnaci.

This page is not some kind of documentation but just to keep a log of this journey.

## Chapter 1
Ok, so the first step is to find a good opensource SV simulator.
